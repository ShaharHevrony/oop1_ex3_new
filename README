3. General explanations:
    The program builds a vector built from an array of complex numbers, and performs various mathematical
    operations on it. The program performs overloading of different operators in order to perform these
    operations in each of the departments to realize the vector.
4. Files:
    vector.h       : Defines all mathematical operators working on the vector.
    zi.h           : Defines all the mathematical operators that operate on the complex numbers.
    ziArray.h      : Defines all operands dealing with allocating memory to the array.

    vector.cpp     : implementation of the operator overloading for the vector.
    zi.cpp         : implementation of the operator overloading for the complex numbers.
    ziArray.cpp    : implementation of the operator overloading for the array.

    main.cpp       : main Defines a test for a complex number.
    vectorTests.cpp: implementation of tests for a vectors.
    ziTests.cpp    : implementation of tests for a zi.
5. Data structures:
    - ZiArray: an array of complex numbers. the constructor get the size of the array and fill it with
               complex numbers as required.

6. Algorithms
    - Multiplication: Calculate the result of multiplying two complex numbers like this:
                      z1(a,b), z2(c,d) => z1*z2 = z(a*c-b*d, a*d+c*b);
    - conjugation   : Calculate the conjugation like this:
                      z(a,b) => conj = (a,-b).
    - norm          : Calculate the norm like this:
                      z(a,b) => norm = a^2+b^2;
    - Division      : Calculate the result of the division of two complex numbers as follows:
                      z1(a,b), z2(c,d) => z1/z2 = z(a*conj(z2)/norm(z2), b*conj(z2)/norm(z2)).

7. Design:
    - Zi     : The class consists of two numbers - real and imaginary. These two numbers together constitute
               a complex number. The class Zi operates various operators on complex numbers of this type.
    - ZiArray: The class holds a one-dimensional array of complex numbers. The class performs memory
               allocation operators on the array.
    - Vector : The class holds a variable of the array type and a number is the size of the array.
               The department performs mathematical operations on the array.
